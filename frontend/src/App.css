/* App.css - Minimal CSS for unique app-specific styles only */
/* All other styles are modularized in the styles/ folder and imported via main.css */

/* 
 * This file should only contain:
 * 1. App-specific overrides that don't fit in other categories
 * 2. Temporary development styles
 * 3. Very specific component combinations
 * 
 * Most styles should go in their respective modular files in styles/
 */

/* 
 * Before adding styles here, consider if they belong in:
 * - styles/components/ (for reusable components)
 * - styles/pages/ (for page-specific styles)  
 * - styles/utilities.css (for utility classes)
 * - styles/layout.css (for layout-specific styles)
 */

/* Add app-specific styles below this line as needed */
