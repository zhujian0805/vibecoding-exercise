# Python Development Best Practices

You are an AI assistant specialized in Python development that follows modern best practices and AI-friendly coding patterns.

## Core Development Principles

### Project Architecture
- **Clear project structure** with separate directories for source code, tests, docs, and config
- **Modular design** with distinct files for models, services, controllers, and utilities
- **Single responsibility principle** for functions and classes
- **DRY principle** - refactor repeated code into reusable components

### Configuration & Environment Management
- **Environment variables** for configuration management
- **Virtual environments** to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts
- **Dependency management** via [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

### Code Quality & Style
- **PEP 8 compliance** for consistent, readable code
- **Code style consistency** using Ruff
- **Type annotations** for all functions and classes with return types
- **Descriptive variable names** for improved clarity

## Key Python Best Practices

1. **Follow PEP 8** for consistent, readable code (4-space indentation, max 79-char lines, organized imports)
2. **Use descriptive, concise variable names** to improve code clarity
3. **Prefer list comprehensions and generator expressions** for efficient data processing
4. **Utilize built-in functions and libraries** instead of reinventing the wheel
5. **Apply the DRY principle** by refactoring repeated code into reusable functions or classes
6. **Use virtual environments** to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts
7. **Write comprehensive unit tests** to ensure code correctness and prevent regressions
8. **Add meaningful comments and docstrings** focusing on explaining why, not what
9. **Handle exceptions gracefully** with try-except blocks to prevent crashes
10. **Keep code modular** with small, single-responsibility functions or classes

## Documentation & Testing

### Documentation Standards
- **Comprehensive documentation** using docstrings and README files
- **PEP 257 convention** for all docstrings
- **Robust error handling and logging** with context capture

### Testing Requirements
- **Comprehensive testing** with pytest framework only
- **No unittest module** - use pytest or pytest plugins exclusively
- **Test organization** - all tests in `./tests` directory
- **Full type annotations** for all test functions

## Mandatory Coding Rules

### Type Annotations
- **ALWAYS add typing annotations** to each function and class
- **Include return types** when necessary
- **Update existing docstrings** to maintain consistency

### Code Preservation
- **Keep existing comments** when modifying files
- **Maintain code structure** while improving quality

### Test Development
- **pytest-only testing** - no unittest module usage
- **Full annotations** for all test functions
- **Descriptive docstrings** for all tests
- **Proper test structure** in `./tests` directory
- **Create `__init__.py` files** in test directories as needed

### Required Test Imports (when TYPE_CHECKING)
```python
from _pytest.capture import CaptureFixture
from _pytest.fixtures import FixtureRequest
from _pytest.logging import LogCaptureFixture
from _pytest.monkeypatch import MonkeyPatch
from pytest_mock.plugin import MockerFixture
```

## CI/CD Integration
- **GitHub Actions or GitLab CI** implementation
- **Automated testing and quality checks**
- **AI-friendly coding practices** for enhanced development workflow
